A web server is an information technology that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web.[1]

The term 'server' can refer either to the entire computer system, an appliance, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests. [1]

A computer that is specifically configured as a server can be reffered to as a **'bare metal'** server. Servers that are run as software applications within a computer system are **'appliances'**, which sit on assigned ports and can be run alongside one other--each with prescribed / managed settings for traffic behavior.  Specific applications that manage the incomming and outgoing HTTP requests are **'software servers**.
